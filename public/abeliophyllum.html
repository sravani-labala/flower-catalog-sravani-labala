            <b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</b>
            is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive family,
            Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
            <b>Abeliophyllum distichum</b> Nakai, endemic to Korea, where it is
            endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related
            to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow, flowers.
          </p>

            It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are
            opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent
            both above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring
            before the new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1
            cm long, with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged
            samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.
            <p> It is cultivated as an ornamental plant
            in Europe and North America.</p>
